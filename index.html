      <p>
        My name is Ryan, I'm 24, currently living in California. I've always
        loved tinkering with computers and was pretty glued to my parents' old
        desktop rig back in 2007 when the internet was pretty new to me. I have
        a diverse background that covers everything from art to agriculture,
        music and more. I specialize in Backend Development, and have over a
        year of professional experience working with the AWS platform to develop
        scaleable and compact web applications.
